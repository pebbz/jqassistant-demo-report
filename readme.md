I'm trying to use commandline jqassistant to scan java jar files and generate report based on their documentation.

* Install Commandline Distribution by following documentation: https://jqassistant.org/get-started/
* Create jqassistant folder and place index.adoc files: https://101.jqassistant.org/generate-reports-about-structures-and-metrics/index.html#_integrate_jqassistant_into_the_build_process
* Run analyze or report doesn't generate any asciidoc documentation
